<!--
Great work!
Good indented, clean code, easy to read.
It's perfect.

Here: var random_number = Math.random()*10; (line 16),
You could have used colorsArray.length instead of 10. So, if you add more colors to the array,
random_number will change automatically.

Here: colorSelected = prompt("Javascript \n\n I am thinking of one of these colors:\n\n "+colorsArray+"\n\nWhat Color am I thinking off?"); (line 22),
If your colors array had had more elements, it wouldn't display well.
You could have used  colorsArray.join(", ")   instead of just colorsArray.
This would display a list with all the elements in thecolorsArray array, separated by a comma and a white space.

You could try to improve your game by accepting Capitalized or lowercased colors indistinctly. -->
