<!-- Here: var color_guess = prompt("I am thinking of these colors: \n\n" + alpha_colors + "\n\nWhat color am I thinking of?");
If your colors array had more elements, wouldn'y display well.
You could have used  alpha_colors.join(", ")   instead of    alpha_colors.
This would display a list with all the elements in the alpha_colors array, separated by a comma and a whitespace.

You could try to improve your game by accepting Capitalized or lowercased colors indistinctly. -->
